    "Each dimension in the EQ-5L-5D is important to measure in healthcare, however, research has shown that the coverage of the EQ-5D-5L is insufficient in several patient groups, and that other dimensions of quality of life should also be measured in order to fully capture the effect or impact of a disease or the treatment of a disease. When a dimension is added to the standard version of the EQ-5D-5L in order to expand its evaluative space, that is referred to as a bolt-on. Therefore, bolt-ons are intended to cover distinct dimensions of quality of life that are not (or insufficiently) covered by the EQ-5D-5L.  \n",

Some condition-specific bolt-ons have also been developed, for example to measure the impacts of psoriasis.\"\"\"},\n",
